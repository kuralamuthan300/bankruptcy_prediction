Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE).\n\nData collected includes company's bankrupted due to the effects of Dotcom Bubble (late 1990s and early 2000s) and Global Financial crisis (2007 - 2008).\n\n**DotCom Bubble :**\n\nIn Taiwan, technology stocks were at the forefront of Dotcom bubble. Companies related to semiconductors, software, and internet services saw their valuations skyrocket. However, the bubble eventually burst, leading to a sharp decline in stock prices. Many investors suffered substantial losses as the market corrected itself.\n\n**Global Financial crisis :**\n\nTaiwan recovered quickly from the global financial crisis of 2007â€“2010, and its economy has been growing steadily since. Its economy faced a downturn in 2009 due to a heavy reliance on exports which in turn made it vulnerable to world markets. Unemployment reached levels not seen since 2003, and the economy fell 8.36% in the fourth quarter of 2008.\n\nDataset URL : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/572/taiwanese+bankruptcy+prediction\nSourcr URL : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Taiwan#2007%E2%80%932010_global_financial_crisis\n\n## About source\n\nFounded in April 1990, Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ) specializes in providing all required and value-added information for fundamental analysis of the securities financial market.
